Exploring the effects of Corrective Demonstration on Q-Learning

The project entails adding Corrective Demonstration, a component proposed by Chernova, to the Q-Lesrning algorithm that was first developed by Watkins.

The project uses a Pacman environment that was created by UC Berkely. The environment uses Q-Learning to allow the Pacman Agent to explore the environment in custom layouts.

Corrective Demonstration was implemented by allowing the user to control the agent through keyboard inputs (Arrow keys or WASD). The user could only control the agent when the Corrective Demonstration mode was activated (by pressing Space on the keyboard), the Corrective Demonstration mode is deactived when the user presses Enter on the keyboard.
